# New Tab Traffic Randomizer

Source of the wonderful [**Chrome extension**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-traffic-randomize/onjkjeianfmpinhbdaibbbhejnffcika) which requests a random URL every time a new tab is opened, for extra <del>privacy</del> <ins>obscurity</ins>.

Important notes: Random means random, so theoretically itâ€™s possible that you end up on a bizarre page. Use the extension at your own risk. Check out the source code, notably the [list of requested URLs](https://github.com/j9t/new-tab-traffic-randomizer/blob/master/nttr.js#L14), to tell whether this is something for you (and to help make the extension better).

Hat tip to [chrome-random-newtab](https://github.com/jimschubert/chrome-random-newtab). Formerly featuring [randomrandom](https://github.com/yozlet/randomrandom). Probably not the only extension of its kind.

Description to be extended.
